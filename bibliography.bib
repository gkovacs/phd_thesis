@inproceedings{Retelny2014,
abstract = {We introduce flash teams, a framework for dynamically assembling and managing paid experts from the crowd. Flash teams advance a vision of expert crowd work that accomplishes complex, interdependent goals such as engineering and design. These teams consist of sequences of linked modular tasks and handoffs that can be computationally managed. Interactive systems reason about and manipulate these teams' structures: for example, flash teams can be recombined to form larger organizations and authored automatically in response to a user's request. Flash teams can also hire more people elastically in reaction to task needs, and pipeline intermediate output to accelerate completion times. To enable flash teams, we present Foundry, an end-user authoring platform and runtime manager. Foundry allows users to author modular tasks, then manages teams through handoffs of intermediate work. We demonstrate that Foundry and flash teams enable crowdsourcing of a broad class of goals including design prototyping, course development, and film animation, in half the work time of traditional self-managed teams.},

abstract="In this article, we describe the usage of persuasion profiles in a large scale, N=1,129, field trial. Persuasive technologies---technologies intentionally designed to influence user behavior---are emergent and becoming more and more individualized and ubiquitous. Individual differences in people's responses to often used persuasion principles---different psychological means by which to influence users---motivate personalization. We describe how, through identification, representation, and measurement, persuasive technologies can personalize their persuasive attempts. Next, we show that dynamically adapting a persuasive technology to the responses of its users increases the effectiveness of the system. Ubiquitous computing systems are, because of their ability to unobtrusively measure user behavior, very well suited for these types of applications.",

    abstract = { Models of advertising response implicitly assume that the entire advertising budget is spent on disseminating one message. In practice, managers use different themes of advertising (for example, price advertisements versus product advertisements) and within each theme they employ different versions of an advertisement. In this study, we evaluate the dynamic effects of different themes of advertising that have been employed in a campaign. We develop a model that jointly considers the effects of wearout as well as that of forgetting in the context of an advertising campaign that employs five different advertising themes. We quantify the differential wearout effects across the different themes of advertising and examine the interaction effects between the different themes using a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). Such a response model can help managers decide on the optimal allocation of resources across the portfolio of ads as well as better manage their scheduling. We develop a model to show how our response model parameters can be used to improve the effectiveness of advertising budget allocation across different themes. We find that a reallocation of resources across different themes according to our model results in a significant improvement in demand. }

abstract="The utility and validity of Bandura's self-efficacy construct was evaluated in a study involving 62 volunteer overweight women. Pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up assessments of self-efficacy and weight loss were obtained in the context of a behaviorally oriented weight-reduction program. It was predicted that (a) weight loss would be related to enhancement in personal efficacy, (b) posttreatment efficacy would be a significant and more accurate predictor of weight loss during follow-up intervals than posttreatment weight loss, and (c) self-efficacy would be related to attrition whereas weight loss would not. Results indicate a significant relationship between weight change and personal efficacy during the follow-up intervals. In accord with Bandura's theory, efficacy expectations predicted outcome during the 6-week and 6-month follow-up intervals, whereas posttreatment weight loss was unrelated to later outcome. In addition, completers had a substantially higher level of personal efficacy than dropouts over treatment and, to a lesser extent, over the follow-up period. Some procedural considerations regarding the assessment of personal efficacy are raised, and the relationship between the cognitively based constructs of goal choice and self-efficacy and task performance are discussed. Finally, given the nature and variability of weight-reduction efforts and the overall time span of the study, it is concluded that results attest to the validity and utility of the self-efficacy construct in predicting behavioral persistence and level of behavioral change.",

abstract="Cognitive-behavioral interventions are the most extensively researched form of psychological treatment and are increasingly offered through the Internet. Internet-based interventions may save therapist time, reduce waiting-lists, cut traveling time, and reach populations with health problems who can not easily access other more traditional forms of treatments. We conducted a systematic review of twelve randomized controlled or comparative trials. Studies were identified through systematic searches in major bibliographical databases. Three studies focused on patients suffering from pain, three on headache, and six on other health problems. The effects found for Internet interventions targeting pain were comparable to the effects found for face-to-face treatments, and the same was true for interventions aimed at headache. The other interventions also showed some effects, although effects differed across target conditions. Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral interventions are a promising addition and complement to existing treatments. The Internet will most likely assume a major role in the future delivery of cognitive-behavioral interventions to patients with health problems.",

abstract="Background: The Internet is increasingly used as a medium for the delivery of interventions designed to promote health behavior change. However, reviews of these interventions to date have not systematically identified intervention characteristics and linked these to effectiveness. Objectives:  The present review sought to capitalize on recently published coding frames for assessing use of theory and behavior change techniques to investigate which characteristics of Internet-based interventions best promote health behavior change. In addition, we wanted to develop a novel coding scheme for assessing mode of delivery in Internet-based interventions and also to link different modes to effect sizes. Methods: We conducted a computerized search of the databases indexed by ISI Web of Knowledge (including BIOSIS Previews and Medline) between 2000 and 2008. Studies were included if (1) the primary components of the intervention were delivered via the Internet, (2) participants were randomly assigned to conditions, and (3) a measure of behavior related to health was taken after the intervention. Results:  We found 85 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, providing a total sample size of 43,236 participants. On average, interventions had a statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior (d+ = 0.16, 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.23). More extensive use of theory was associated with increases in effect size (P = .049), and, in particular, interventions based on the theory of planned behavior tended to have substantial effects on behavior (d+ = 0.36, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.56). Interventions that incorporated more behavior change techniques also tended to have larger effects compared to interventions that incorporated fewer techniques (P < .001). Finally, the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions was enhanced by the use of additional methods of communicating with participants, especially the use of short message service (SMS), or text, messages. Conclusions: The review provides a framework for the development of a science of Internet-based interventions, and our findings provide a rationale for investing in more intensive theory-based interventions that incorporate multiple behavior change techniques and modes of delivery.

abstract = {Summary The objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate the effectiveness of web‐based interventions on weight loss and maintenance and identify which components of web‐based interventions are associated with greater weight change and low attrition rates. A literature search from 1995 to April 2008 was conducted. Studies were eligible for inclusion if: participants were aged ≥18 years with a body mass index ≥25, at least one study arm involved a web‐based intervention with the primary aim of weight loss or maintenance, and reported weight‐related outcomes. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen studies aimed to achieve weight loss, and five focused on weight maintenance. Heterogeneity was evident among the studies with seven research questions examined across interventions of varying intensity. Seven studies were assessed for effectiveness based on percentage weight change, with four studies deemed effective. Although the four meta‐analyses suggest meaningful weight change, it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of web‐based interventions in achieving weight loss or maintenance due to heterogeneity of designs and thus the small number of comparable studies. Higher usage of website features may be associated with positive weight change, but we do not know what features improve this effect or reduce attrition.}

abstract="This paper reviews the current body of empirical research on persuasive technologies (95 studies). In recent years, technology has been increasingly harnessed to persuade and motivate people to engage in various behaviors. This phenomenon has also attracted substantial scholarly interest over the last decade. This review examines the results, methods, measured behavioral and psychological outcomes, affordances in implemented persuasive systems, and domains of the studies in the current body of research on persuasive technologies. The reviewed studies have investigated diverse persuasive systems/designs, psychological factors, and behavioral outcomes. The results of the reviewed studies were categorized into fully positive, partially positive, and negative and/or no effects. This review provides an overview of the state of empirical research regarding persuasive technologies. The paper functions as a reference in positioning future research within the research stream of persuasive technologies in terms of the domain, the persuasive stimuli and the psychological and behavioral outcomes.",

% - 2. Multi-sources of the cause of slacking. Not just about PC based internet.
% - 3. Intervention might backfire, has no effect/negative effect.

% 1. The importance of this study. The efficacy of a behavior change system should be measured by a real behavior change. In our study, measuring only the time spending on computer is not sufficient to measure the real efficacy. Measurement on mobile device usages will also play a role, as mobile devices are becoming more and more popular.

abstract="Recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. This has resulted in a growing need of the operators to understand the usage patterns of the mobile apps used on these devices. Previous studies in this area have relied on volunteers using instrumented devices or using fields in the HTTP traffic such as User-Agent to identify the apps in network traces. However, the results of the former approach are difficult to be extrapolated to real-world scenario while the latter approach is not applicable to platforms like Android where developers generally use generic strings, that can not be used to identify the apps, in the User-Agent field. In this paper, we present a novel way of identifying Android apps in network traces using mobile in-app advertisements. Our preliminary experiments with real world traces show that this technique is promising for large scale mobile app usage pattern studies. We also present an analysis of the official Android market place from an advertising perspective.",

    abstract = { Purpose – After being implemented for two years, HKBUtube (the official video streaming site developed by Hong Kong Baptist University Library) has become a popular source of videos for the university. This video site also begins to draw the attention of the community. When more libraries are starting to respond to the demand for mobile service, the HKBU Library decided not to remain aloof. Before committing itself to the provision of an additional platform, the Library carried out a proof of concept to investigate the likelihood of library users watching videos via a mobile app when the web counterpart was available. This paper aims to investigate this issue.Design/methodology/approach – Through building a small‐scale mobile app to showcase and display videos, this paper studies the use of the app and the popularity of watching videos via smartphones. To yield a more accurate result, a web counterpart was also developed for comparison of usage.Findings – The data suggest that the usage between the app and website version was about the same. This study also demonstrates the power of Apple's marketing support, the large group of international users, and the effect of broadband speeds.Originality/value – Usage data presented in this paper support the importance of the provision of mobile video collections. This paper also offers practical information that can assist academic libraries in justifying and developing mobile services, in particular mobile media collections. }

However, within the behavioral sciences in general, and the persuasive technology field specifically, scholars rarely focus-on, or report the negative outcomes of behavior change interventions, and possibly fewer report a special type of negative outcome, a backfire. This paper has been authored to start a wider discussion within the scientific community on intervention backfiring. Within this paper, we provide tools to aid academics in the study of persuasive backfiring, present a taxonomy of backfiring causes, and provide an analytical framework containing the intention-outcome and likelihood-severity matrices. To increase knowledge on how to mitigate the negative impact of intervention backfiring, we discuss research and practitioner implications.",

abstract = {We introduce flash teams, a framework for dynamically assembling and managing paid experts from the crowd. Flash teams advance a vision of expert crowd work that accomplishes complex, interdependent goals such as engineering and design. These teams consist of sequences of linked modular tasks and handoffs that can be computationally managed. Interactive systems reason about and manipulate these teams' structures: for example, flash teams can be recombined to form larger organizations and authored automatically in response to a user's request. Flash teams can also hire more people elastically in reaction to task needs, and pipeline intermediate output to accelerate completion times. To enable flash teams, we present Foundry, an end-user authoring platform and runtime manager. Foundry allows users to author modular tasks, then manages teams through handoffs of intermediate work. We demonstrate that Foundry and flash teams enable crowdsourcing of a broad class of goals including design prototyping, course development, and film animation, in half the work time of traditional self-managed teams.},

Persuasive technologies---technologies intentionally designed to influence user behavior---are emergent and becoming more and more individualized and ubiquitous. Individual differences in people's responses to often used persuasion principles---different psychological means by which to influence users---motivate personalization. We describe how, through identification, representation, and measurement, persuasive technologies can personalize their persuasive attempts. Next, we show that dynamically adapting a persuasive technology to the responses of its users increases the effectiveness of the system. Ubiquitous computing systems are, because of their ability to unobtrusively measure user behavior, very well suited for these types of applications.",

    abstract = { Models of advertising response implicitly assume that the entire advertising budget is spent on disseminating one message. In practice, managers use different themes of advertising (for example, price advertisements versus product advertisements) and within each theme they employ different versions of an advertisement. In this study, we evaluate the dynamic effects of different themes of advertising that have been employed in a campaign. We develop a model that jointly considers the effects of wearout as well as that of forgetting in the context of an advertising campaign that employs five different advertising themes. We quantify the differential wearout effects across the different themes of advertising and examine the interaction effects between the different themes using a Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). Such a response model can help managers decide on the optimal allocation of resources across the portfolio of ads as well as better manage their scheduling. We develop a model to show how our response model parameters can be used to improve the effectiveness of advertising budget allocation across different themes. We find that a reallocation of resources across different themes according to our model results in a significant improvement in demand. }

abstract="The utility and validity of Bandura's self-efficacy construct was evaluated in a study involving 62 volunteer overweight women. Pretreatment, posttreatment, and follow-up assessments of self-efficacy and weight loss were obtained in the context of a behaviorally oriented weight-reduction program. It was predicted that (a) weight loss would be related to enhancement in personal efficacy, (b) posttreatment efficacy would be a significant and more accurate predictor of weight loss during follow-up intervals than posttreatment weight loss, and (c) self-efficacy would be related to attrition whereas weight loss would not. Results indicate a significant relationship between weight change and personal efficacy during the follow-up intervals. In accord with Bandura's theory, efficacy expectations predicted outcome during the 6-week and 6-month follow-up intervals, whereas posttreatment weight loss was unrelated to later outcome. In addition, completers had a substantially higher level of personal efficacy than dropouts over treatment and, to a lesser extent, over the follow-up period. Some procedural considerations regarding the assessment of personal efficacy are raised, and the relationship between the cognitively based constructs of goal choice and self-efficacy and task performance are discussed. Finally, given the nature and variability of weight-reduction efforts and the overall time span of the study, it is concluded that results attest to the validity and utility of the self-efficacy construct in predicting behavioral persistence and level of behavioral change.",

abstract="Cognitive-behavioral interventions are the most extensively researched form of psychological treatment and are increasingly offered through the Internet. Internet-based interventions may save therapist time, reduce waiting-lists, cut traveling time, and reach populations with health problems who can not easily access other more traditional forms of treatments. We conducted a systematic review of twelve randomized controlled or comparative trials. Studies were identified through systematic searches in major bibliographical databases. Three studies focused on patients suffering from pain, three on headache, and six on other health problems. The effects found for Internet interventions targeting pain were comparable to the effects found for face-to-face treatments, and the same was true for interventions aimed at headache. The other interventions also showed some effects, although effects differed across target conditions. Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral interventions are a promising addition and complement to existing treatments. The Internet will most likely assume a major role in the future delivery of cognitive-behavioral interventions to patients with health problems.",

abstract="Background: The Internet is increasingly used as a medium for the delivery of interventions designed to promote health behavior change. However, reviews of these interventions to date have not systematically identified intervention characteristics and linked these to effectiveness. Objectives:  The present review sought to capitalize on recently published coding frames for assessing use of theory and behavior change techniques to investigate which characteristics of Internet-based interventions best promote health behavior change. In addition, we wanted to develop a novel coding scheme for assessing mode of delivery in Internet-based interventions and also to link different modes to effect sizes. Methods: We conducted a computerized search of the databases indexed by ISI Web of Knowledge (including BIOSIS Previews and Medline) between 2000 and 2008. Studies were included if (1) the primary components of the intervention were delivered via the Internet, (2) participants were randomly assigned to conditions, and (3) a measure of behavior related to health was taken after the intervention. Results:  We found 85 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria, providing a total sample size of 43,236 participants. On average, interventions had a statistically small but significant effect on health-related behavior (d+ = 0.16, 95\% CI 0.09 to 0.23). More extensive use of theory was associated with increases in effect size (P = .049), and, in particular, interventions based on the theory of planned behavior tended to have substantial effects on behavior (d+ = 0.36, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.56). Interventions that incorporated more behavior change techniques also tended to have larger effects compared to interventions that incorporated fewer techniques (P < .001). Finally, the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions was enhanced by the use of additional methods of communicating with participants, especially the use of short message service (SMS), or text, messages. Conclusions: The review provides a framework for the development of a science of Internet-based interventions, and our findings provide a rationale for investing in more intensive theory-based interventions that incorporate multiple behavior change techniques and modes of delivery.
