% \section{Research Questions}

% Our research questions relate to the effects of randomizing interventions on intervention effectiveness and attrition, as well as the importance of users' sense of control.

% RQ1: Do interventions decrease in effectiveness over time?

% RQ2: Does randomizing which interventions are shown each visit help combat this decrease in effectiveness, compared to always showing the same one?

% RQ3: Does randomizing which interventions are shown each visit have any effects on attrition, compared to always showing the same one?

% RQ4: Are users who enable or disable interventions during onboarding less likely to attrition?

% RQ5: Does improving users' mental model by reminding them of how the system works when presenting a new intervention help reduce attrition?

% RQ6: Does improving users' sense of control by allowing them to opt-out of seeing a newly introduced intervention in the future help reduce attrition?
