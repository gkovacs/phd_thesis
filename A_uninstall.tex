\chapter{Responses to Uninstall Survey}
\label{ch:uninstall}

The following are the free-form responses to our uninstallation survey. Some earlier feedback items may be missing, as we accidentally lost them during a server migration. We also removed or modified items that revealed the submitter's identity or personal information.

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
1: It did not work (nothing was registered)

2: another testing

3: Times logged don't accurately represent engagement with the site, e.g. playing a video in the background while viewing a different tab didn't count toward time but leaving the youtube home page open and idle did.

4: Neighbor installed this to my computer without my consent!

5: because i want to

6: muy molesto

7: Looked like some nice options for streamlining sites, but it's actually a nanny. I don't need a nanny whining at me.

8: I reached my goal to reduce time spent on certain pages. Thanks folks!

9: Didn't seem what I was expected. Installed two minutes ago and removed it.

10: I wanted something to track all websites, rather than having to opt-in to each.

11: I was just worried, I mean it's standford and all, but a bunch of students tracking everything I do and all my browser history, that just felt too much of a price to pay

12: ';

13: I forgot that I already had another program that did essentially the same thing for the computer in general instead of just for this particular browser

14: ...

15: changed my mind

16: Translate in french please

17: surveys done

18: You covered up useful buttons.  Don't do that.

19: Installed for a study, now the study is over.

20: just wanted to track time spend on youtube

21: it wasn't working on tumblr.com

22: I noticed that I was going on imgur, youtube, facebook (my choice of addictive sites) more, after I had installed the extension. So, I'm uninstalling. I think the extension made me more conscious of the fact that I was visiting the sites, but maybe the rewards were making me go back to the site? I'm not sure.

23: This is Matt, just deleting and reinstalling for something

24: Look and feel weren't great, I feel like it annoys more than it helps.

25: I don't need it :P

26: Wasn't sure if it is effecting battery life

27: Setting page was continuously popping up despite filling the setting.
Settings kept on reseting to default, despite setting the facebook specific timers they kept on getting disabled.

This was causing way more distractions than facebook which is sad.

28: it was just annoying you out of not using sites, not convincing you to. It became like ads, they are always there. But you don't like them and turn them off with ad-block.

29: l should be 0 this time

30: Hello,
This is the web browser for my raspberry pi 3 b. I use  website such as youtube and reddit for information and programming advice etc e.g terminal and python info. I do not wish to use less of these websites while doing this. However on my phone and laptop I do want to use less of certain site, as I use those devices for socialising and fun but it has become rather consuming of my time. BTW Habitlab is great application I hope the team achieves what it set out to do.
Thank you kindly
Regards
Chris

31: I don't spend a lot of time on facebook or other social media.

32: Was awesome, but was making chrome really slow, i mean really slow!
Seems like you need to fix some memory issues.

33: don't need, just wanted to try it
thank you

34: I liked the interventions but not on every page change or load, that was just a bit too much. Also I couldn't work out how to disable the thumbs up gif that appeared when I closed a site I was trying to reduce use of. Now that was annoying. Otherwise though it's a cracking extension! Good stuff.

35: Just testing

36: does not fucking work, hiding the newsfeed in particular

37: I was bored with it.

38: Did not turn off when requested. Kept on nagging even when disabled.

39: Found out I have good habits already.

40: I often browse incognito and it does not pick that up. Not that it should.

42: i don't like this

43: i love this

44: Debugging (am at Stanford)

45: They are preventing me from adding youtube songs to my youtube playlists.

46: testing to see if server is up

47: Only need on my main computer, and way too many little notifications in the bottom right corner with no clear easy way to turn them off

48: Extensions worked for only 5 minutes (until I started to modify the settings).

It's now completer borked. Clicking on "Options" sends the browser in an infinite loop.

Too bad, this looked like a useful project.

49: no like interference in all

50: There was no way to turn off notifications in chrome

51: It does not have any auto sync features. because I use Multiple OSes that's why I'm having so much problem.
Please add auto sync features  of Habits.

52: Just was testing the app

53: I wanted a timer for every "domain", it can be good for stadistics of time..

54: gyguv

55: may cause lag

56: Catastrophic stability problems after installation; may be due to a different extension

57: Couldn't figure out how to turn off the "clapping" gifs that appear when leaving a website.

58: Dont need it on work computer, just at home

59: downloaded twice accidentally

60: this is my wasting time computerand i dont need it

61: would not tun off even after I "turned this off for today" when I tried and corrected it it told me it was already off. Also was set to only run during work hours, and never stopped on the evenings or weekends. Basically it did nothing but bother me when i wanted to be online, and never helped me curb the times i didn't. So utterly useless!

62: d

63: A cool concept! Unfortunately, I don't use Chrome that much so it is not very useful for me. A mobile application would work much better for me since I tend to procrastinate on my phone.

64: There was a very irritating bug with Klout.

65: I love the idea—but I'd like stronger nudges and better tracking of the time spent on each site.

66: I was interested in tracking my usage to start, instead of setting interventions that I may not actually be concerned about. Additionally, much of my "wasted time" usage is on mobile which this wouldn't help me track.

67: Made Facebook unusable. Which might be the point?

68: Someone else installed. Did not want it

69: Gave up

70: LAG.....

71: i'm chopping and changing computers too much...

72: The "goals achieved" notification was annoying, I disabled it and it still intervened

73: n

74: hjhjk

75: .

76: only test install, good apps guys, regards from spain wihout user anonymous from castila la mancha :)

77: Could not edit settings properly. Even though I removed Gmail from sites to avoid, I still got notifications.

78: Should be able to monitor all websites first automatically, and not only user defined sites.

79: Testing

80: i don't need it

81: I think it messes with the Google Play Music

82: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

83: Made me realize I don't have Facebook addiction, spending less than 30 minutes of my desktop time on it per day.

84: ./'l

85: Would have preferred a gentle log - perhaps emailed - giving usage statistics. In the present form this operates like pop-up ads. Still, it was reasonably insightful into understanding my usage for the time I used it. Thanks.

86: So

87: Seeing if this extension is causing gmail compatibility issues

88: Creating an intervention (such as temp_intervention created in the tutorial) does not seem to work at all. I'm reinstalling immediately to see if that fixes it.

89: I prefer the "Forest" application.

90: kept telling me 8/8 achievements complete when in reality I had not.

91: For some reasons Facebook blocked me and I am trying to figure out the reasons. What I know that the Hitlab extension was deactivated (not by me) and then, boom, I was blocked.

92: Software was buggy

93: all good

94: did not appreciate the clapping people. had issues with google music and now checking if an extension is the cause

95: not sure I really neded it - mostly use facebook and youtube for technical research and discussion. Good idea, though

96: disturbing gifs

97: I just don't use my laptop as much as I thought would be necessary for an intervention.

98: Not interested

99: I rarely waste time on my desktop. This would be much more useful on my mobile phone.

100: not what i was looking for in software.

101: Interventions are not forceful enough. They are too easy to click around or disable.

102: realized not spending as much time on websites as i thought...

103: хэ

104: Uses a lot of CPU and memory without doing anything

105: Mostly it was the bar covering up facebook message indicators.

106: Unable to change settings that appear in startup.  I couldn't find a way to set one type of nudge for all websites. It is really annoying to change settings for every single website. Hence reinstalling it.
One good feature will be to create a group of websites with similar nudge settings!

107: settings changed on me all of a sudden with caue and i got sick of going back over settings over and over to turn things off.

108: I like all or nothing.

109: It's quite possible something else was causing lag -- but lag there was.  I also was just checking it out.  I don't really use facebook or youtube.

110: I figured out that I actually don't spend as much time as I thought I was. I thought I was watching videos for 4 to 5 hours a day, but the timer stated only watch them for 30 minutes.

111: Not only annoying but they cover up important part of the screen

112: sucks

113: Cause Facebook news feed to constantly refresh itself so I was unable to read or click any links there.

114: I used the extension to curb my Facebook habit and eventually gave up Facebook altogether- something I've been wanting to do for a long time.  Thank you.

115: no need

116: Don't need it

117: I do not use it anymore

118: non lo voglio

119: My youtube doesn't work becauseof it

120: battery use

121: I love the app - I'm just removing temporarily to see if it's affecting another app (Freedom.to)
Thanks

122: I'm weak....

123: tuke

124: I'll be back soon

125: I just didn't understand the concept before downloading and it's intentions aren't my demons as it happens.

126: became unusefull for me;
good initiative any how

127: NA

128: Extension did not work as expected and I was experiencing bugs

129: I want to try other types of chrome extensions to block time-consuming websites and don't want to mess with your data.

130: performance... seems to use a lot of CPU all the time...

131: THis extension was causing system wide lag

132: I use social media for work - but your app is great and I will keep it running on my personal accounts

133: Por enquanto não preciso desse tipo de ferramenta no meu navegador.

134: Daily results show 0 time spent for almost all sites, despite that definitely not being the case.

135: excessive battery  consumption

136: All it took was the fact that settings don't sync, so I would have to reconfigure for each instance of Chrome.

137: Very Good, but want to reduce installed extensions.
Might install again later.

138: Spend too much time on the relevant platforms for work purposes.

139: dcsdf

140: Blocked usage of 1Password extension, which is critical.

141: 1

142: lags and bugs

143: Time spent differs drastically

144: wanted to install it on my private profile, not my work one.

145: just checking it out

146: dssd

147: I think I misunderstood the point of the program.

148: The Youtube sidebar still loaded.

149: didn't really need it. Turns out... I don't really binge watch after all.

150: No use

151: I need something mor physical, i can be distracting out of my computer

152: ijgougoughu

153: Consumes too much CPU

154: On Facebook, I couldn't click on regular posts (not just clickbait posts) that I truly wanted to see. So I disabled the clickbait feature and it was still happening. Then I disabled the whole app, but it's STILL happening. So now I have to delete the whole app to see if this fixes the problem :(

155: cxsd

156: nnfgnfgnngfnfntdrsxnrtsynr.shrehmsortihmnsrth,rtesmhposritmh[oimaerg][ognm[o9trignjm3io[54ny9ui35y-

157: Not effective for me - the interventions just slowed down my procrastination and made it take longer unfortunately! :)

158: its stupid asl

159: Basically just irritating.

160: I like what you are doing and see a great purpose. but when I was on certain pages the pop up from habit lab was in the way of seeing what I wanted to look at and then I felt frustrated and somewhat invaded......  due to the fact that I thought I had shut it down and then somehow it was on again. 
perhaps there is a quick habit blurb.... about how to shift when you get stuck on the computer etc, or using triggers to support positive habits or kaizen, 
If it is purely research base maybe there needs to be finessing around how the habitlab pops up or the look of it, it's placement on the site..... right now it feels slightly naggy, perhaps it could feel supportive in the look and placement of it. Like I said .... I like what you are doing.... It's super smart and hopefully will help gather  the  data you are looking for.

161: Didn't seem to work

162: Kept me off Facebook, but was not smart enough of a tool to know when I needed to check a message versus just idling

163: Used it over my study period, don't need it anymore. Thank you for it!

164: gmail and youtube stopped loading

165: seems cool but i feel its too intrusive, probably helps others who sit on facebook all day

166: Interfers with printing emails -- pops up as if one wants to print it

167: reinstalling so i can see the habitlab panel, not finding how to access this normally?

168: I was hoping for an analysis of my internet activity. This seems to be designed solely for the purpose of reminding users of youtube and facebook time.

169: Does not remove youtube sidebar and comments section

170: Caused interruptions when listening to youtube in the background. Many videos would randomly give an error and refused to be played about 30 or so seconds in.

171: I achieved my goals

172: It gave me the info I needed

173: it reached its goal as I am more cautious about my net usage

174: Didn't catch any website anymore

175: need to reinstall

176: Needs to synchronize stats between machines, ineffective otherwise.

177: I deleted the wrong one

178: Installed, because I was curious. I don't have issues with wasting time in the Internet.

179: i dont actually spend too much time anywhere so after trying it for a few months (i think?) its rly just annoying. but if you do have an issue with going on facebook or reddit (or whatever) too much, i'm sure its very helpful. if that ever happens i'll reinstall it :)

180: On one of my other synced devices (RCA Tablet 10.1 w/windows 10 new April 2018 ver.) it keep crashing and literally giving me a Black Screen of Death. It would just go bank and one time it did ask if I wanted to submit a crash report all other times the error was not scene just would not work.

181: Wasn't using it

182: fuck useless, useless team

do better things with your life

183: xzy

184: I clean toolbar and delete all extension

185: I feel it does not effective.
Rescuetime works better for me.

186: only need on work computer

187: a

188: No instructions on how to use it.

189: Was not effective at all. Provides a false sense that something is being done, making the problem worse. StayFocusd will do well to block these sites in their entirety rather than try to alter the design that tech giants spend billions perfecting.

190: ;not finals anymore!

191: wr

192: I wanted to crush my laptop's screen every time a stupid high five you saved a minute fucking awful meme was making an appearance cool marketing of extension but treating me like a stupid mindless kid is beyond annoying .

193: I needed to get rid of the Ram Chrome was using.

194: interventions overlay makes webpages unusable

195: I couldn't find how to de-select some (already selected) web pages.

196: Ticker blocked screen content

197: i will be back

198: hgh

199: ram usage

200: Using HabitLab in Chromium on a linux operating system, the browser became slow and unresponsive.

201: Didn't really need it

202: Those "nudge" ads were too annoying

203: It was marking work sites as time wasters. It made the numbers very misleading

204: was using multiple extensions fuck extensions they open up like 9 processes on my compute that pull 24k memory each

205: I wish you could be more interactive with the nudges/interventions, they felt preset without much control over them

206: After I disable it, it continue to be active while I was working on my research paper. I thought it will help me when I spend to much time on social media sites, but not when I was on google researching or writing. 
It is good, but not for me. 
Thanks

207: Sometimes I actually spent more time on the site because of the content obscured by the intervention, otherwise did not see habits change.

208: Added the extension at work. Need it at home.

209: Love the idea, but genuinely don't go on Facebook or Youtube or Amazon

210: It's Drew :-)

211: Hootsuite won't connect with FB but it'll connect with Twitter and LinkedIn. I think HabitLab might be the reasonl.

212: I used to enjoy the app but I'm not a huge fan of the new update in which I receive constant prompts on tabs that I'm using for work (Dropbox etc). Even though I clicked 'no reminders for this site' it continued to pop up.

213: it stopped working time ago

214: Wasn't working when I said to disable.

215: erfdcvgre

216: ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffr

217: 沒中文

218: doesnt work with incognito mode

219: I need to free up ram.... otherwise the extension is great!

220: In the beginning seems to work with Firefox but crash then :/

221: I set it to 15 mins and then opened three links from the same site... each tab gave me a new annoying warning and then the third one told me "time's up" and tried to turn off the site.  Also it's super confusing which button to click to make the warnings go away for my damn 15 mins.  Uninstalling because this is just too annoying when I just wanted a simple 15 min timer.

222: I do not need that.

223: fdih

224: I have my habits under control for now! Thanks!

225: Wanted to turn on all nudges at the same time

226: can't tell if it's available in incognitio mode

227: If I want a nudge, I WANT A NUDGE. PLEASE STOP DISABLING THE ONE I WANT TO SHOW ME SOME OTHERS, I WANTED THAT ONE

228: The nudges change all the time, and I would like to choose definitely which to apply.

229: Would not stop blocking sites when app was off on "turn off for the day"

230: Didn't need it any more thanks!

231: Don't need it anymore

232: Android initial automated setup buggy.  couldn't proceed out of 'display over other apps' step.  maybe will try again with later version.

233: Said no nudges were active even though they were

234: The timer was incorrect (way below actual value), making most of the interventions useless

235: Disabling interventions didn't stick, specifically "Bouncer".

236: обновил разрешение и оно перестало работать

237: going to purchase new laptop

238: Brakes youtube

239: 問題

240: I enjoyed this -- it was very helpful for a month or two, but after that I felt like I'd gotten most of what I would get out of it. Now I don't have as much trouble managing my time and I can just use a basic site blocker if I'm going to some site too much. Thank you for improving my life!

241: Prompts to try new interventions were annoying

242: lost youtube thumbnails

243: x

244: xxxxx

245: Had it installed on work computer, and needed to remove it to comply with extension installation policy.

246: Broke YouTube, and I don't really need it on desktop.

247: Slowed internet down

248: Causing so many problems than advantages

249: Great product. Just updating some settings.

250: didn't use much.

251: Glitchy. The turn off button did not work half the time and other buttons did not work.

252: n/a

253: the extension is still primitive and buggy... it shows at midnight a notification that I've accomplished my goal while it's not exact it's just notifying from wrong data about the upcoming day not the previous one...

254: way too much lag

255: Interventions were annoying.  I will still try to control my browsing habits.  I wanted it to only work from 8:00 A.M. -- 5:00 P.M., but when I try that, the interventions still go all of the time...

256: The extension was preventing youtube thumbnails from loading correctly

257: Some assets arent loading on youtube and other sites.

258: I really like everything about this app, but I despise how often it asks me how it's doing. I set the settings as I wanted them and dont want constant popups asking me additional things.

259: I don't find myself needing it in my new job.

260: Starting to break in numerous areas on Chrome, such interventions showing up that aren't selected, broken websites (e.g. Youtube thumbnails).

261: Need youtube for work

262: Was not working correctly

263: asdfasdf

264: high CPU usage

265: Because you redirect to this fucking page when I say I'm done with you. Stop being a dick.

266: Turns out I don't actually waste that much time on specific sites!

267: I did kind of like seeing how long I had been on gmail, but in general it wasn't very long, so I wasn't getting feedback that really gave me insight into where my time is poorly spent.  I also don't use FB and twitter much.  I could see in the activity monitor that a chrome helper was taking up way too much bandwidth and killed it, and it became clear it was related to the habitlab.

268: Doesn't works correctly

269: bl

270: Everything was fine with the app, I liked it. I'm just not interested in using it anymore because I don't have work to do on my computer.

271: no more need

272: Constant CPU consumption...

273: If you could link all browsers and devices used throughout the day, then it would be better.

274: rther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ej

275: rther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ejrther h rthe gh rtjhertjer ej

276: Was inconsistent as well

277: I felt that I would need to put in some time to learn how to use it, and not knowing how to use it the interventions just seemed annoying. Maybe if there were a two minute video I could watch that said "to set it up do these three things" or something like that. I guess that is a round about way of saying that it feels too complicated.

What I really want is to have a row of timers on the top of the screen that show me how much time I have spent on this website today, this week, this month, and the same for all websites that I consider time wasters (facebook, news sites, twitter). It would be really nice to be able to go to a page that shows the times for all websites and I can group them together e.g. bank and credit cards (to answer the question "how much time do I spend managing my finances") etc.

278: I downloaded this app as an experiment. Unfortunately, I work in an advertising agency, and being rather social inclined is a solid part of my job. Hence, the need for social media.

279: I tested out of curiosity. No real need.

280: Sites I told Habitlab to ignore would continually show pop-ups. Not worth the hassle.

281: Thanks.  i instaled it because i read a review and [raises of it.  Wnated to expeience and hence insalled.  Now i t

282: Thanks.  i installed it because i read a review and [raises of it.  Wanted to experience and hence installed.  Now it is enough.

283: Checked to see what it is and found it is not useful for me

284: Malfunctioning intervention updates

285: .Feedback

286: Constant 16-21% CPU usage while the browser is open, even while HabitLab is toggled 'Off'

287: It wasn't working properly, I had set many sites to 1 minute assassin, and it did not work at all

288: got tired of it. It's an awesome app but not for this moment

289: Just wasn't using it anymore

290: It really worked for me during the time I needed to sit down and do very boring chores on my laptop. Now those boring chores (aka writing my dissertation) is done, I am ready to remove this app and indulge myself in a little bit of web-surfing. I will reinstall it if my self-control is out of wack.

291: Decided to simply block the site using Block Sites

292: Did not store settings between launcher restarts

293: Don't use it nowadays

294: was not  showing pie chart  and other data .

295: I just wanted to start with a simple background timer for the pages i visit and go from there, but its so hard to disable everything. Very annoying.

296: bla bla bla

297: I haven't taken the time to set it up to not be annoying.  I may reinstall at some point!  I was really just trying it out to see how it might help some of my students..

298: not intuitive to have the banner appearing the minute i start using the internet - this should focus on as of a specific time or when more than x time is used on one site and as of then present the user of most requently accessed sites, length of time on them and suggestions on when to set alerts

299: Would be nice to have the option to choose which kind of notification you are given vs giving feedback on what was just done.  As well as move the notification to a side of the screen that's not blocking what you're currently doing (timers that stay up longer).  Otherwise it helped me a lot to curb my time wasting online.  I feel I can manage on my own for now but will reinstall if it starts to get out of hand again. Thanks!

300: On few computers I had to decided EACH AND EVERY TIME WHAT I WANT... bit I decided already what I want... it was extremely DISTRACTING :(

301: I decided to stop using it.

302: not interested

303: h

304: Loved it, but was causing crippling lag whenever I had a few tracked tabs open. Maybe I'm imagining it, but when I split my browser into multiple windows, it became unusable.

305: Adding an option to completely block websites without a way to get around it for a set period of time would be great

306: Unfortunately I felt likely the nudges were creating more dependence on FB and other social media

307: Was sometimes forced to answer what I thought about the nudges.

308: Keeps crashing my browser.

309: An opt in for sending anonymous feedback would have been appreciated

310: put in  a switch off button

311: confuse!!!!!!

312: Worked well, don't need it anymore.

313: The nudges were completely ineffective and ended up being more intrusive than anything.

314: Sorry, but it's a shit. It constantly overwrites the settings, switches on modules that have never been plugged in. It would be good. Bye bye.

315: I was just looking into whether it was blocked behind my employer's firewall. It's not. Thanks!

316: interventions felt a little too lax. also conflicted with another extension I was trying out, Prod, that I decided to keep using.

317: Timing seemed to reset when I went to another page, so the clock/measurement did not seem effective

318: Got over the digital habits I wanted to get over. Thank you!

319: ,

320: Will reinstall soon

321: aaa

322: half the interventions were really annoying and made me think the internet was down

323: It wasn't helping me to curb my web surfing. I simply became better at tolerating the irritation of the interventions.

324: Less passive than expected

325: When I've opened youtube, it hasn't shown the player.

326: Absolute annoying piece of shit

327: It totally worked. It worked so much that I don't even need this app anymore ;) I no longer spend more than 5 minutes a day on Facebook and other distractions. Thank youuu :)

328: It was just driving me crazy. And I couldn't find out how to get rid of it. I thought it would measure instead it bothers. 

I didn't want to get rid of it, I wanted to turn it off, maybe a gentle email in a month or a year when it would gently email me or something saying it has been improved. You know?

329: Use a lot of processing power

330: I didn't notice the sniper one often and I would be in the middle of a message to my wife and it would close it so I would have to start over again.

331: I really liked this tool. I think it actually worked to create some good habits. But it's slowing my system down.

332: i dont like it

333: fu

334: no thing

335: was great and helped me out of facebook.
As i am out now - no need for Habitlab anymore, thanks!!!

336: z

337: Did not see anything changed with only 1 nudge per page active. And yes, i had goals set!

338: I installed it on the wrong browser, going to reinstall in the right one

339: i didn't use that so much

340: 44

341: the banner would be on top of youtube search bar, thats it

342: I don't need to know I've been on Youtube every 2 minutes while watching videos. That's obnoxious

343: soy un aidcto

344: ,khjb

345: I don't use for a long time. I can control myself.

346: bvcbc

347: displaying the habitlab goals was distracting

348: Going to give away this machine

349: I was having a problem and wanted to see if HabitLab was contributing to it

350: I need to reduce my online reading in general, without naming specific sites (there are too many).

351: I'm reinstalling it to see if it fixes the bug : nudges would not activate...

352: Being unable to see a history of my behavior was a big factor in my removing this feature.

353: No longer interested in the help.

354: Prevented work as a web developer. Stopped cards opening - "Detected Link"

355: I think I'm now in control of my habits, thanks!

356: caused multiple websites to malfunction. i'll most likely try re-installing it.

357: interventions didn't make me use the sites more. It just irritated me.

358: I'm not sure if this extention collecting my information or not so I think the best way is uninstall

359: Breaks everything without any reason

360: seems buggy after updates. uninstalling and reinstalling usually helps.

361: It was buggy

362: I was testing it to recommend to students. Interventions were not necessary for me, personally.

363: No longer needed

364: bye

365: Your messages are intrusive and hard to remove/clear from the screen. The resulting annoyance defeats the purpose of having this extension....Please work on this.

366: '
/

367: w

368: add a feature to turn it off for more than a day

369: the placement of the timers and text box is annoy, sometimes it blocks the search box etc

370: I can't turn off HabitLab with Gmail while crashes continuously if the addon is running

371: I liked the interventions during periods where I was very busy, but they didn't feel flexible enough for every day use. The interventions were a bit too intrusive, and the option to "turn off" for a day often didn't work or froze the system. Still, I would consider re-installing in the future.

372: Many times i'm not able to turn off the intervention temporarilry and they keep coming back when i refresh the page.

373: fans are running at 6500rom on macbook air

374: slowing chrome

375: Just cleaning up everything after getting hot by WeKnow virus

376: I felt like all of the interventions just ended up getting in my way and didn't seem to be helping either. I think for whatever reason the interventions Habit Lab supports were not effective in changing my online browsing behaviors.

377: Bad

378: i thought the app would be more effective for my addiction

379: na

380: didn't really do anything

381: it works

382: HitLab taught me that I value almost all of the time I spend on social media and don't consider it wasteful.

383: very high cpu usage

384: Simply wasn't using it. It's great, it just wasn't for me.

385: no longer required

386: They popped up in places I needed to get to and I couldn't move them away.

387: In this period I'm just full of things to do that I barely have time to open Facebook, but also in my free time I prefer doing other things so I can say "mission accomplished"! BTW great extension, if I'll need it again I'll reinstall it for sure.

388: Bug.  Would cycle through the same "medium, heavy, light" screen even when I made a selection

389: Chewing up too much of my CPU

390: you kept popping up, once I tell you I need you to count minutes, you kept asking me the same question always! You should have where one marks what he/she wants and when he/she needs the change, he can get to settingd

391: dsadas

392: The objective nudge was not working at all and the hide comments nudge was active even though i set it myself off. I'm trying to reinstall to see if it fixes itself

393: I changed my work and almost not using bad habits sites :)

394: kept asking me what level of interventions i wanted when i opened a page. when opening multiple tabs on FB i had to click "light touch" for every single tab. maybe it didnt save my setting since i have low disk space but ende dup being too annoying

395: Sorry, just couldn't figure out how to get rid of the timer at the top of Gmail. And it is particularly annoying that I was typing up homework. Couldn't bother going thru to fix it, instead I just removed this addon

396: It was preventing from doing some of my work and I do not use facebook and similar sites as such, any more.

397: Didn't need it

398: need to work with facebook and were annoyed to have it on my work computer

399: I was just testing it out because I'm interested in your research! - Cori Faklaris, CMU

400: I wasn't ready to fully use it. Great for a work machine, my home machine my habits are way too unproductive, yet satisfying. Didn't want to log it as annoying, as the concept is great and ill prob reinstall soon without interventions. Thank You!

401: It was really buggy. It would not remember settings.

402: Gmail could not be loaded. Got the message Error 404. The requested URL was not found on this server. That’s all we know.

403: Settings should be set only once and not asking me every time I visit a site
Too much focus on Facebook, almost useless for persons who don't use it

404: I never got the time to check it out

405: I wanted to study my habits with some figures and charts, not a nagging system to get rid of some addiction. The software is clearly feature-rich, but it is too much for my interest, and by default it is VERY intrusive and pushy. Instead of showing giat buttons blocking the content, why not just a little pop-up, that you can deal with later? cheers

406: Please, I'll be back soon

407: available websites are not an issue, need option of adding more sites

408: I don't think I need it.

409: Interventions were inconsistent. Sometimes showed, sometimes not.

410: I use a whitemode setting with Blocksite, which blocks all websites until I allow it. Also, scrolling on the setup page was a buggy mess with a lot of stuff too large to interact with.

411: Can't use in incognito tabs.

412: There currently seem to be a lot bugs that making it behave confusingly

413: Dont really need it. Just wanted to try it.

414: I've worked quite a bit to optimize my devices for minimal distraction, so although I found the tool useful for many without that discipline, this was just not for me.

415: Too much unnecessary prompts!

416: It didn't seem to register my selections so I had to make them anew each time I opened gmail.

417: my problematic use is on my iphone, not this computer

418: The extension didn't work on YouTube. None of the selected interventions seemed to occur when browsing the site. I did have the site activated in the settings.

419: 'Nudges' would not disable. If I could only use the notification/banner nudge, I would be happy, but no matter how many times /where I click 'turn off' for Scroll Freezer, it will not disable.

420: Just wanted to purge some bad data. Left a tab on overnight, and it thought I spent all night on Youtube.

421: Heavy handed mode doesn't seem to work

422: Interventions were disruptive. I had to spend additional time to get around the interventions which meant more time was spent on the computer. All I wanted was a simple timer to track my usage.

423: I wasn't spending as much time on reddit and twitter as I thought I was. HabitLab helped me be more conscious of the time am spending, it just wasn't as much as I thought it would be.

424: this is a bug when used didnt initialize that stuff for the end

425: I think it's part of why Chrome is suddenly chewing up SO MUCH MEMORY and I can't have my computer running this slow. Interferes with work.

426: I don't seem to have a problem. My facebook use was about 11 minutes. It is a good idea though.

427: Very buggy. It decided I had reached my max for Twitter as soon as I logged on

428: New Macbook

429: Makes hangouts not load chat history

430: Makes hangouts not load chat history. Now this form doesn't close on submit.

431: I mostly just wanted to monitor my time spent on various websites, this doesn't provide as detailed of a breakdown as I'd like (think something more like screen time from iOS)

432: Would love it to be less intrusive - was expecting interventions to be more streamlined and UI-friendly - too clunky and while I chose 'light weight' you took over my whole page. It also didn't recognize cross-tab, when the domain was the same, I had to re-submit interventino notes.

433: Didn't really provide the data I was looking for

434: It was showing up on other sites I hadn't asked for, and was buggy on twitter.

435: Youtube would glitch, and HabitLab would keep popping up with Annoying Interventions, even when I disabled it. Glitchy.

436: Falta idioma español, saludos desde México

437: I need more than top 5 most visited websites

438: I decided to use a program which can also track time spent outside of Chrome.

439: It wasn't working! I wasn't receiving any nudges on my target sites even though it was on and I had every nudge enabled.

440: While having a job now it began to be annoying having these interventions on my personal laptop.

441: m

442: i selling my laptop

443: Can't see historic trends

444: Does not get along with my work network

445: It's good, but i use youtube to listen to music while working so it's not a time waster for me.

446: /

447: re

448: all good, just realized sites I was tracking are needed for work too often

449: i need a instant cut off like a website blocker.

Ideally your tool would then show me how often i had tried to access the blocked sites

450: 68щда

451: 68щданшднд

452: A very good idea. Nicely done. What gets measured gets done. But I'm not so much interested in creative ways to limit web-surfacing of particular sites as much as getting a handle on how much time I'm spending everywhere. There appear to be other other Chrome extensions that are better suited to my needs.

453: Not for this moument. But its very useful.

454: Full of bugs

455: Wasn't valuable for me.

456: I want to use in another time, when I get a job for instance

457: Wouldn't allow various mailboxes in Gmail to load

458: нет русского языка

459: Conflict with other extensions...

460: no reason. just cleaning up

461: I already clicked a box that is self explanatory. Why do I need to write stuff here?

462: didn't work

463: blah

464: 11

465: On Android, the overlay messages, once closed, would still disable the ability to interact (tap) on apps. I'd have to close them and reopen.

466: Did not feel effective

467: the time-on-gmail pop-up kept breaking my concentration.

468: asd

469: Not clear what it was doing for me, did not see a clear summary of data (maybe I didn't look?), interventions annoying.

470: malo

471: Stop eating CPU

472: Would be great if I could customize periods of usage as different segments. It's annoying to turn off nudge for every youtube tab for instance when watching youtube IS the objective.
Maybe a simple on-off button, and twice a day or something analysis of the usage, and customizing nudges based on the usage. 
For example, I may be working and playing music at the back on YouTube. The nudges would override the autoplay and I'd be switching to YouTube to more often.

473: Constant high CPU usage

474: I did not need it

475: It just didn't work as well as I needed :(

476: I could not choose which nudges to activate

477: It keep asking me to choose?

478: After I started with HabitLab, I was no longer able to view lowercase X's and Y's. i.e. The message above states: "Sorr to see ou go!" Not sure if it was HabitLab or another issue, but that was the big change to my computer so I'm removing it.

479: cleaning up chrome - will reinstall later

480: I decided it was more effective to block the url from my system entirely.

481: Did not feel the need to use this

482: honestly i didnt know habitlab was to keep track of online usage only, I thought it was going to help with all Goals Settings. Such as smoking less; Drinking more water; keeping up with a good diet; Etc. Good work but this app is not for me. Thanks You. I will keep you guys in mind if i ever need help with my online usage.

483: Not forceful enough

484: Buggy, especially for non-preset sites.

485: For me, a program like this would be far more beneficial on my phone than on my computer. I'm really pretty productive on my computer. I spend too much time on email, but at least that's productive work email. It's on my phone that I tend to get lost in scrolling.

486: P.S. Playing the intervention at the beginning and at the end of YouTube videos

487: please support chinese ，please support china web 。

488: b

489: Some of the interventions were effective, but I'm going to try a more aggressive blocking extension.  Thank you for doing this work, and I wish you the best in changing people's habits!

490: bugs. when browsing news website,  open news in new tab, the Lab will give wired actions, such as  recognize the new tab as another website. Seems it can not fit "multi tab of one website" feature.

491: was using a gig of RAM

492: Didn't seem to save and utilize my settings, and did not sync across my multiple browser instances.

493: didn't hide dashboard, comments and suggestions on youtube

494: Worked briefly, but eventually it just became too easy to ignore the interventions.

495: testing

496: Screen doesn't seems to be fit when using!

497: didn't need anymore

498: it was good at first but then i started ignoring it so on to something else unfortunately

499: It simply was not working

500: I realized I didn't spend a lot of time on the websites I was controlling so no need for the extension.

501: not what i was looking for

502: It didn´t prevent me from going to webs I didn´t want to visit, I visited them anyway and just turned off the extension. It wasn´t strong enough

503: I felt that the nudges always changing wasn't affective - mainly got it to stop the feed on youtube from showing, but it kept on popping up again... otherwise nice app!

504: is bugged. can't delete site from the list and can't add it

505: Because use requests to modify sites. It may make the server have a big load of requests, some of then block my access because of that. Like Dribbble

506: wasn't using it

507: Every time I visited a site, it would ask me for the low/medium/high/etc on how it should handle things. That needs to be remembered. Got obnoxious.

508: tg

509: i dont need it

510: I do not know how to use it

511: Found it wasn't necessary.

512: im just lazy and not intersted in improving myself

513: I feel it's an emotional problem. Not a time management problem. Thank you.

514: I just wasn't using it. i installed it and didn't do anything with it.

515: didnt want to set it up on this computer. still on my other systems

516: legit bad

517: need firefox version. chrome sucks

518: battery drain

519: It stopped working after a while. Even the most effective of them.

520: Huge RAM usage (250MB) in Opera browser on Mac (macOS High Sierra).

521: Problem solving - will reload when problem is solves.

522: settings are confusing.

523: I was hoping to be able to do something like pomodoro method with this

524: didnt work

525: suggestion to choose level of intervention keeps popping up despite me choosing it

526: sdasda

527: no reason i was just trying it if i feel like actually using it i will reinstall it

528: I wasn't using it

529: at first it was annoying and i noticed a lot of lag time on loading pages which was more annoying than anything, then it was there as a reminder or more like a notification, then it just didn't really help at all

530: I was tired of seeing a countdown on my gmail. I turned off all alerts for gmail, but it was still there.

531: the time counter continues to work even when I'm afk

532: trying to install it again, just did not work

533: The prompt about which mode to use kept reappearing.

534: I have no time do evaluate this plugin.

535: My PC started having Blue Screen failures/crashing.

536: it was good but i give up im lazy :/

537: crashes

538: Disabling because I didn't need to be super focussed anymore, was useful for final exams season though!

539: Takes up way too much memory/RAM.

540: Estoy probando con otra app

541: HabitLab was causing some issues with my browser and seemed to be seriously slowing down my computer. Really liked the extension, which did a great job in preventing distractions, but the computer slow down was too much of a trade off.

542: Just didn't need it. Good job anyway, thx. :)

543: When I am in that downward spiral of distraction, I see the interventions of HabitLab as an externally imposed authority to rebel against. This makes me want to engage in the distracting websites even more.

544: Slowing down my computer.

545: I'm using LinkedIn, twitter for reading professional content.
So tracking the way I consult doesn't work for me.
Thanks

546: I've been using browsers other than Chrome lately, so the information from HabitLab isn't terribly accurate or helpful.

547: It works fine, I just didn't feel the need for it anymore (which is probably a sign that it worked). Thanks for helping me out!

548: The interventions are great for when I'm wasting time, but some of the time I actually do need to get on social networking sites and Amazon for work-related tasks (and I don't want to disable HabitLab for the rest of the day, because those sites *can* turn into time wasters after work).

549: wanted a site blocker

550: I don't even know what it is trying to achieve... It asked me multiple times how much restriction I wanted - why does it have to ask more than once? And I set it to be a minimal intervention and it was nagging me even after watching just one 5-minute video... Also, I set it to show many different kinds of UI elements on youTube, but it only ever showed the one blocking the video player before the video starts and after it ends...
I honestly couldn't find any use to it in its current state, even though the concept is really good and I could really use a well implemented version of this... Now, it's just training me how to skip its one and only video-blocking element without ever giving a thought... It has no meaning at all, sorry.

551: I have a website blocker (Cold Turkey) already. I was looking for something that would issue regular reminders to stay focused. Your utility may do that, but I couldn't immediately see how, so I've uninstalled so I can something targeted at that.

552: DIdn't use the product much. Its a great concept though!

553: An absolute nightmare. I just wanted to receive reminder of the time connected. Difficult to understand and set up.

554: Battery impact too high

555: esta en ingles

556: don't neeed it

557: Interventions consistently failed to remember preferences.

558: The browser version didn't offer the same stats the app version did, it looked like two different products.

559: Not addiction left

560: I feel like I retrained myself a bit with the app and it's annoying to have around now. Will re-install if I ever feel like I need it again.

561: The Chrome extension LeechBlock better suited my needs for reducing time spent on certain sites.

562: Youtube videos would not load while the plugin was active, even if no interventions were active

563: I'm just an awful procrastinator, really

564: dhedh

565: vote:8

566: <3

I love you guys, and this app and extension are both incredible, but I'm not in a place where this is effective for me right now. This is really user friendly and intuitive but I noticed I just kept ignoring all interventions so I'm going back to square one and sort of resetting all my online stuff, including this. Thanks for creating something incredible and I'm sure I'll be back!

567: You guys will no longer be harvesting my data. Bad policies and awful app!

568: Orly wanted to track time and deactivate comments and sidebar in Youtube. Got tired of the popups and have no idea how to disable them.

569: Kept turning on settings I kept turning off. I just wanted a time keeper, not all the other interventions

570: I'm doing pretty well managing my online time and now the interruptions aren't helpful for me any longer.

571: on a chromebook

572: Moderation. I tried HabitLab hoping to form new browsing habits and slowly change them for the better over time. What turned me off was that the nagging would take place instantly and aggressively, new installs should default to the lowest settings and learn the habits before intervening. Using negative enforcement from the very second you tread on a site does not motivate you to change, it teaches you that HabitLab is a hardline tool that simply annoys and makes you want to turn it off - the exact opposite behaviour you are after. From my experience, fully blocking websites via my DNS was a much more enjoyable way to stop visiting sites cold-turkey and I still have these in place. Definitely consider a delay (5 mins?) before a nagging feature is used and then ramp up the annoyance factor, HabitLab is simply too abrasive out of the box.

573: Install again after some days.

574: may have caused interference with GMAIL working properly

575: hhh

576: obrigado

577: It was very easy to ignore. I need something that is EXTREMELY heavy-handed.

578: I can see how this could be quite useful to others -- it just wasn't for me

579: оккокококок

580: this is a competer used by mani people... 
Also the nudges are just ok, but the constant feedback you ask for is anoying

581: this is a competer used by mani people ... 
Also the nudges are just ok, but the constant feedback you ask for is anoying

582: bom mais atrapalha

583: Was not tracking my websites properly. It said I would hit goals when I did not.

584: offering only 60 minutes of youtube per day, no choice for HOURS

585: hi

586: dcfhv12jbkwasrdgjhbkqd

587: It was nice to know that I was making an effort to reduce my wasted time, but in the end my "habits" developed to include silencing the habitlab pushes haha

588: dedede

589: it did not allow me to block activity that is problematic. it focused on social media sites where i don't have a problem getting distracted.

590: Interfered with printing every time -- I had to cancel the Print dialog, dismiss HL, and then return to printing.

591: I am using youtube for education and math learning. it's really annoying for me, nice work guys btw.

592: Didn't need it anymore (not a student!)

593: I dont use it

594: could not sign in to keep my preferences across all devices and each time I went on a  tracked website I had to answer what my preferences are.

595: i accidentally downloaded it

596: "How aggressive do you want habit lab to be ?" pop up every window

597: Finished university so it was no longer helpful for my needs

598: to much computer resources

599: I had bugs, whan i was on youtube it always asked me for the entensity of nudges ...

600: Sometimes it shows up, sometimes it does not. Also it does not remember my choices.

601: Kept asking for type of intervention on a custom site, no matter how many times a choice was made as to level desired. Level choice was only remembered until the tab was closed.

602: Trying to reset nudge intensity

603: Keeps asking for level of agression

604: Interventions kept repeating after being turned off

605: sadwfdwqfqf

606: I was using it for productivity in college time, it is now the summer and it keeps annoying me.

607: crashed chrome

608: It was super useful to keep track of time spent on websites I knew I was procrastinating on and it got me through exam season really well! (I'll reinstall it when college starts again)

609: I realized I didn't really need it

610: It was glitching and kept asking me which nudge I wanted on each visit even though I had already set the nudges.

611: there are other extensions that provide all time stats

612: man 10 % CPU for this really?

613: A smaller range of simpler interventions would be more effective.

614: jiji

615: Fun to try, but got a little annoying at times.  I might be back!

616: Using 800MB of RAM

617: Extensions seemd to use 4-5% of a CPU in BG, impacting battery life.

618: I prefer to use the app version, because I spend most of my time there than on my office desktop.

619: I was hoping to have a specific habit applied to a specific website. For example, I would love to set Facebook at only 3 minutes or the 1 minute assassian. However, this might not work for something like Youtube, which I often use for work. While I love some of the features, having the random approaches didn't help me and made it seem to get in the way.

620: Uneeded now

621: yep

622: Your product does not compare to our kawakawa fortnite borgar hense forth u and ur mom have a vast varietry of diabetes

623: wish it had a mode only to show how long have been on a particular site = I need to go on FB for work - dont want to answer questions all the time - dont want to feel like and addict when really I would prefer to get away from it - just want to know when time spent gets uneconomic

624: they were intrusive and ugly

625: You don't need to ask everytime if I need a light touch or a heavy hand.

626: I've enjoyed using it and liked the approach. 
I liked the timer, but it constantly popped up "how do you want me to behave (minimal -> invasive)" on visits which was annoying (including items that I had turned off "permanently" (maybe it was per-site, whereas I expected anything turned off like that to be global (perhaps a choice would be good?)

627: Didn't let me log out of Facebook.

628: I was hoping to see a weekly graph to compare my progress

629: It consumed 1Gb of RAM!

630: did not use

631: Rallenta il mio PC

632: Shit execution.  All this did was make me angry at the ham-fisted way in which it tried to block me.  Good idea, rethink your approach.

633: ugly

634: Trying to disable because it thew me off Twitter in the middle of a research tweet. Didn't mean to remove it from Chrome.

635: I dont need this anymore. And in this situation, interventions became annoying.

636: Kept asking me about what intervention i wanted to use every time I visited a site, got annoying

637: e

638: The app says it has permission to change and see all the data for websites I visit.  This seems to include usernames and passwords.

639: fà schifo al cazzo

640: It really helped me during my undergraduate career when I needed to remain focused when I had the ability to wander, but I have graduated now!

641: Returning computer

642: Didn't ever use it

643: I no longer need to stop getting distracted

644: used a lot of cpu,  on laptop, was killing my battery

645: fas

646: Interventions were not strong enough - I wish they happened automatically instead of asking me each time how much I wanted it to intervene

647: Interventions were not working

648: I was just testing

649: Fucking annoying popup on every fucking site I visit

650: Didn't really have a use for it.

651: i realized: when I want or need to work, I work, and when I want to relax, I want to do that. This just got in the way.

652: sdvbcx

653: messed up twitter 1password autofill

654: I sopped working :( I'm trying to reinstall it

655: Worked at home and needed it. I don't work at home anymore.

656: Bad Extension and google emailed me saying data was being stolen!

657: So much irritating when you are actually working on your laptop, need to check your email or make some research for work.

658: Job done

659: changed interventions but it seemed to keep asking me how aggressively to do it. i just wanted to track time!

660: no

661: What is the point or the goal of habitlab?  I think is senseless you'll people don't like to be bother with anything? they just want to be left alone.....!!!!

662: I never used it.

663: I'm done with school! I only had this installed to keep me focused while I was doing homework

664: https://github.com/habitlab/habitlab/issues/638

665: high CPU use

666: My habit has been broken - thank you.

667: Basically, the features don't work the way they're supposed to. I wanted to use this mostly to help me curb excessively media streaming chain-watching (I've gotten rid of my social media some time back) but the timer doesn't work correctly. As soon as you press full screen the timer stops counting so the majority of the time you spend on the tab isn't counted. Also, ideally, you should be able to categorise types of websites and set limits for the category rather than limits being set for an individual website. Otherwise if the goal is to set a 1hr limit per day of media streaming, as the features are currently configured, you could still end up watching an hour of Netflix, an hour of Stan, an hour of Youtube, etc. in a day and still be meeting your configured target according to this tool.

668: Don't feel I waste time enough on sites such as Youtube and Facebook

669: I just went out of my way to dodge all the interventions. It's a ME problem, not an app problem, sorry
