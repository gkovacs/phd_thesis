\section{Uninstallation Survey Responses}

The HabitLab system also includes an uninstallation survey that users can optionally answer when they uninstall. We show a screenshot in Figure~\ref{fig:uninstall_survey}.

We asked users their reasons for uninstalling. Users could select more than one of our predetermined categories, and leave free-form feedback if their reason did not fit into any of our categories. Of a total of 4635 users who responded to our uninstallation survey, they chose 5782 reasons. A breakdown of uninstallation reasons is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:uninstall_reasons}. The most common reasons for uninstalling concerned the interventions themselves -- interventions being too annoying was the most commonly selected reason, followed by interventions being considered as ineffective. A complete list of free-form feedback users left about their reasons for uninstalling is shown in Appendix~\ref{ch:uninstall}.
