\begin{abstract}

Technological interventions can help end users achieve behavior change goals such as spending less time on sites. We wished to investigate the effects of alternating between several interventions, rather than always showing the same one. We ran a in-the-wild study on HabitLab, a Chrome extension we publicly released that helps users reduce time spent on sites like Facebook. We find that 1) alternating between interventions can benefit effectiveness, and 2) alternating between interventions can have a detrimental effect on attrition rates. We believe that declines in intervention effectiveness over time, and a lack of user control, underly these effects.

%Technological interventions can help end users achieve behavior change goals such as spending less time on sites. Prior work has found that algorithmically choosing among several interventions (via a multi-armed bandit) rather than always showing the same intervention can have benefits on intervention effectiveness. We sought to investigate whether some of this gain may be due to users being exposed to more novelty and not growing blind to the interventions. In this paper we find that while alternating between interventions may benefit effectiveness, it can have a detrimental effect on attrition rates.

% We suspect that users develop blindness to interventions over time, hence we wished to investigate whether novelty effects exist and to quantify their magnitude.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex

% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
